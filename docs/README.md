- Signal issue detection and fixing
- Multiple visualization options (Plotly and Matplotlib)

### 3. [Enhanced ECG App](enhanced_ecg_app.md)

The `enhanced_ecg_app.py` is an advanced application for comprehensive ECG analysis with a focus on atrial fibrillation detection, feature extraction, and interactive visualization.

**Key Features:**
- Advanced ECG analysis with 100+ cardiac biomarkers
- Multi-classifier approach (when available)
- Interactive visualizations with annotations
- Detailed feature extraction and display
- Analysis logging for comparison
- Data export capabilities
- Signal issue detection and fixing

### 4. [ECG EDF Analyzer](test_ecg_analyzer.md)

The `test.py` application is a specialized tool for analyzing ECG data from EDF files with a focus on data validation, visualization, and diagnostics.

**Key Features:**
- Medical-style ECG display with green lines on black background
- Data validation and repair for problematic EDF files
- Automatic detection of identical channels and data issues
- Signal normalization and scaling
- Detailed diagnostic information
- Heart rate analysis and R-peak detection
- PDF report generation

## Common Dependencies

All applications rely on the following core technologies:

- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **NumPy/Pandas**: Data handling and numerical operations
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: Visualization libraries
- **NeuroKit2**: ECG signal processing
- **MNE**: EDF file reading

## Custom Modules

The applications use several custom modules:

- `ecg_holter_analysis.py`: Contains the `HolterAnalyzer` class for long-term ECG analysis
- `ecg_arrhythmia_classification.py`: Contains the `ECGArrhythmiaClassifier` class for arrhythmia detection
- `ecg_medical_analysis.py`: Contains the `ECGMedicalAnalysis` class for medical reporting
- `ecg_advanced_features.py`: Contains the `ECGFeatureExtractor` class for detailed feature extraction
- `ecg_multi_classifier.py`: Optional module with the `ECGMultiClassifier` class for multi-model classification

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib plotly neurokit2 mne scipy fpdf
   ```

2. Run any of the applications:
   ```
   streamlit run ecg_streamlit_app.py
   streamlit run ecg_dashboard.py
   streamlit run enhanced_ecg_app.py
   streamlit run test.py
   ```

3. Upload an EDF file or use the sample data generation features (when available)

## Use Cases

- **Clinical Analysis**: Use `ecg_streamlit_app.py` or `enhanced_ecg_app.py` for detailed clinical analysis
- **Research Visualization**: Use `ecg_dashboard.py` for research-focused visualization
- **Education**: Use any application for educational purposes
- **Problematic Data**: Use `test.py` for handling and diagnosing issues with ECG data

## Notes

- These applications are designed for research and educational purposes
- They are not intended for clinical diagnosis without professional oversight
- Large EDF files may require significant memory resources
- The applications include detailed explanations of metrics and analyses for educational value
