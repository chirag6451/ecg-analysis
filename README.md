A comprehensive suite of applications for ECG signal processing, visualization, and analysis with a special focus on atrial fibrillation detection.

## Features

- **Advanced ECG Signal Processing**: Implements various filtering techniques and signal enhancement algorithms
- **Atrial Fibrillation Detection**: Specialized algorithms for detecting AF patterns in ECG recordings
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Rich, interactive dashboards for exploring ECG data
- **Multi-classifier Approach**: Combines multiple classification methods for improved accuracy
- **Holter Analysis**: Support for long-term ECG recordings analysis
- **Medical Reporting**: Generation of comprehensive medical reports with key cardiac metrics

## Applications

1. **AFDx: Advanced ECG & AF Detection** - A specialized tool for detecting and analyzing atrial fibrillation in ECG signals. Based on advanced algorithms from research on HRV analysis and AF pattern recognition.

2. **ECG Dashboard** - A visualization-focused dashboard for ECG data with multiple views, heart rate trends, and rhythm analysis.

3. **ECG DeepDive: Signal to Insight** - Advanced ECG analysis with over 100 cardiac biomarkers, detailed feature extraction, and multi-classifier approach.

4. **Holter ECG Review** - A comprehensive web application for analyzing ECG data from EDF files with a focus on arrhythmia detection and medical reporting.
